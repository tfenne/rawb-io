//! Read-ahead / write-behind byte IO: a [`ThreadedReader`] and [`ThreadedWriter`]
//! that put a dedicated thread on one IO end, with a user-space byte ring buffer
//! in between, so a pipeline stage never blocks on the kernel pipe.
//!
//! A single-threaded reader+worker+writer is coupled to its neighbours only
//! through the small OS pipe buffer (~64 KiB on macOS), so any blip in one stage
//! stalls the others. Pipelines are typically bursty at both ends —
//!
//! ```text
//! producer | this stage | consumer
//! ```
//!
//! — where the producer's per-item cost varies and the consumer periodically
//! flushes a chunk to disk. Putting a dedicated IO thread and a larger buffer
//! between a stage and each pipe decouples the compute from the IO.
//!
//! * [`ThreadedReader`] wraps a [`Read`] source. A background thread reads
//!   *ahead* into the ring, so the consumer's `read` / `fill_buf` is served from
//!   user space instead of blocking on the kernel. Implements [`Read`] and
//!   [`BufRead`].
//! * [`ThreadedWriter`] wraps a [`Write`] sink. The caller's `write` returns as
//!   soon as the bytes land in the ring, and a background thread flushes them
//!   *behind* the caller. Implements [`Write`], plus an explicit
//!   [`finish`](ThreadedWriter::finish).
//!
//! The buffer between the two threads is a byte ring ([`ringbuf::HeapRb`]). That
//! is an implementation detail — the crate is named for its *behavior*, not the
//! ring — and may change.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Read-ahead: wrap any [`Read`] and consume it as usual; the kernel reads run
//! on a background thread.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io::Read;
//! use rawb_io::ThreadedReader;
//!
//! let mut reader = ThreadedReader::new(std::io::Cursor::new(b"hello, world".to_vec()), 1 << 20);
//! let mut out = String::new();
//! reader.read_to_string(&mut out).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(out, "hello, world");
//! ```
//!
//! Write-behind: wrap any [`Write`]; `write` returns as soon as the bytes are
//! buffered, and [`finish`](ThreadedWriter::finish) blocks until the background
//! thread has flushed everything, surfacing any error it hit.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io::Write;
//! use rawb_io::ThreadedWriter;
//!
//! let mut writer = ThreadedWriter::new(Vec::new(), 1 << 20);
//! writer.write_all(b"hello, world").unwrap();
//! writer.finish().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Design choices
//!
//! * **A single up-front ring allocation** ([`ringbuf::HeapRb`]) for the bytes —
//!   recycled forever, no per-chunk heap traffic.
//! * **[`thread::park`] / [`unpark`](std::thread::Thread::unpark)** for blocking.
//!   Lock-free fast path when the ring isn't full/empty; only the rare contended
//!   case parks.
//! * **`read` straight into `vacant_slices_mut`** — one memcpy (kernel→ring)
//!   instead of two (kernel→temp + temp→ring).
//! * **Symmetric on write**: the caller pushes bytes into the ring directly; the
//!   IO writer thread drains via `as_slices` + `write_all` + `skip`.
//!
//! # `unsafe`
//!
//! The crate sets `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`. Its only `unsafe` is the two sites in
//! the read loop: the `MaybeUninit<u8>` → `&mut [u8]` cast that lets `read` write
//! straight into the ring, and the matching `advance_write_index` that publishes
//! exactly the bytes just read. Both will be removed when [`std::io::BorrowedBuf`]
//! stabilizes (rust-lang/rust#117693). The hard lock-free concurrency `unsafe`
//! lives inside [`ringbuf`], not here.
